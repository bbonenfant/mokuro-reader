# Mokuro Reader/Editor

I'm an admirer and user of the Mokuro project.
One feature that was missing from the project was an ability to easily
correct and modify the output file(s).
So I decided to try to make such a tool, and this is the result.

## Feature Wishlist

- [x] Mokuro Editor
- [x] Reader Magnifying Glass
- [ ] Volume Ordering & Filtering
- [ ] Tracking Edits to for an "Undo Stack"
- [ ] Add "Bookmarks" & "Chapter Markers" to Volumes
- [ ] (Stretch) Anki Integration (with image cropping)

## Important Notes

* I am not affiliated with the mokuro project in any way -- I'm mostly just
  trying to build something useful to me.

* This app reads .mbz.zip files created from
  [this fork of the mokuro repo](https://github.com/bbonenfant/mokuro).
  These files contain both the manga image files and the OCR output.

## Summary

This is a web app where you can upload, read, and modify your Mokuro
manga volumes (where the files are generated by
[my fork of mokuro](https://github.com/bbonenfant/mokuro).)

All files are local to your browser â€” absolutely nothing leaves your machine.
Your manga volumes are stored in your browser's IndexedDB system,
which means the content of your library is specific to your machine
and browser, i.e. your files are not shared between Chrome and Firefox nor
between your laptop and desktop.

When uploading volumes, you will be prompted to "Persist Your Storage".
This will protect your files from being deleted if your browser ever
needs to free up storage space. Your modified volumes can be exported
and downloaded as .mbz.zip files from the Home/Library page by clicking
the "Prepare Download" button and then the "Download" button.

In the Reader view,you can enable editing mode by pressing "E".
This mode allows you to modify the OCR output generated by Mokuro (the textboxes).
Functionality includes editing the text, resizing and moving the textboxes,
creating new textboxes, and adjusting the font size.

Most actions have a keyboard shortcut, and some have mouse-based equivalents.
Additionally, a "magnifying glass" can be enabled by right-clicking the reader.
When in the reader view, press "H" to display the help banner.

## Local Development

You can run a local version of this app using the following command:

```shell
trunk serve
```

Adding the  `--no-autoreload` is also helpful when actively developing.

Note: local storage is specific to the combination of hostname and port.
Volumes stored at http://localhost:8080 will not be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
