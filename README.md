# Mokuro Reader/Editor

I'm an admirer and user of the Mokuro project.
One feature that was missing from the project was an ability to easily
correct and modify the output file(s).
So I decided to try to make such a tool, and this is the result.

## Important Notes

* I am not affiliated with the mokuro project in any way -- I'm mostly just
  trying to build something useful to me.

* This app reads .mbz.zip files created from
  [this fork of the mokuro repo](https://github.com/bbonenfant/mokuro).
  These files contain both the manga image files and the OCR output.

## Summary

This is a web app where you can upload, read, and modify your Mokuro
manga volumes (where the files are generated by
[my fork of mokuro](https://github.com/bbonenfant/mokuro).)

The web app stores all files locally to your browser -- absolutely nothing
leaves your machine. Your manga volumes are stored in your browser's IndexedDB,
which means that your library is specific to the combination of your machine
and browser, i.e. your volume is not shared between Chrome and Firefox nor
between your laptop and desktop.

When uploading volumes, you will be prompted to "Persist Your Storage".
This will protect your files from being deleted by the browser when it
needs to free up storage space. Your modified volumes can be exported
and downloaded as .mbz.zip files from the Home/Library page.

When reading manga volumes from your library, you can enable editing mode and
modify the OCR output generated by Mokuro (the text boxes). Functionality
includes editing the text, resizing and moving the text boxes, and adjusting
the font size.

Most actions have a keyboard shortcut, and some have mouse-based equivalents.
Additionally, a "magnifying glass" can be enabled by right-clicking the reader.
When in the reader view, press "H" to display the help banner.
