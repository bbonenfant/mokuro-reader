# Mokuro Reader/Editor

## Important Notes

* Unsupported on Webkit-based browsers (Safari).
  It should work fine as a reader but editing text is finicky.

  Drag-resizing is a bit broken on chromium browsers, but is
  on track to be fixed: issues.chromium.org/issues/363806067

  Should work best on Firefox.

* I am not affiliated with the mokuro project in any way -- I'm mostly just
  trying to build something useful to me.

* This app reads .mbz.zip files created from
  [this fork of the mokuro repo](https://github.com/bbonenfant/mokuro).
  These files contain both the manga image files and the OCR output.
